# Remove a Snippet

If you are an anonymous user and your user cookie matches that of the snippet owner's, you can simply click the delete button on the snippet detail or my code snippets page.

As a registered user, you can easily delete a snippet by clicking the delete button on the snippet detail page or on my code snippets page.

However, if your user cookie does not match the snippet owner's (for instance, if you have changed browsers or devices or deleted your cookies), you will need the delete token provided during the snippet creation process. If you have the delete token, you should refresh the snippet detail page by adding `?remove` to the end of the link. This will cause the delete button to appear. If you have lost your delete token, neither you nor we will be able to delete the snippet unless it violates our Terms of Service. In such cases, please contact us via email.
