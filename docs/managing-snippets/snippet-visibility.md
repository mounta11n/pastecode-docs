# Snippet Visibility

Pasted code snippets, except for password-protected and "For Myself" (user-only) snippets, are publicly accessible, even if you don't select the indexable toggle. This means that anyone with knowledge of your private (non-indexable) snippet link can access the snippet. If you choose to enable the indexable toggle while pasting a snippet, it will be accessible to search engines and bots, and it will appear in our snippet search engine results. Otherwise, your snippet detail page will be marked as "noindex". However, it's important to note that search engines and bots may or may not adhere to this instruction. Therefore, private (non-indexable) snippets always carry the risk of being accessible to search engines and bots.

To prevent spam, we manually analyze the content of each pasted snippet. Even if a snippet is password-protected, private (non-indexable), or user-only, it should not violate our Terms of Service (T.O.S.). As a result, we may have access to the content of your password-protected snippet, even if we do not know or cannot retrieve the password. Please be aware that we do not store your snippet's password as plain text. It is hashed with salt and saved using the same method as your user account's password.

Regarding encrypted snippets, PasteCode.io cannot view their content. Encryption takes place on the client side, and the secret passphrase is stored in the visitor's browser. Consequently, our spam detection mechanism disregards encrypted snippets. Additionally, we are unable to effectively review reports related to encrypted snippets since we cannot access their content. As with all other snippets, PasteCode.io does not assume any responsibility for encrypted snippets either.
