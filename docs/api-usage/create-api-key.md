# Creating an API Key
After logging into your account, navigate to the [Profile](https://pastecode.io/profile) page to create an API key.

To enhance the security of your API key, you can choose the expiration date and set up an IP address whitelist. Additionally, you have the option to toggle the `Allow Login` feature to utilize your API key for login purposes.
